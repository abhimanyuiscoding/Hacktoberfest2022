Problem Statement: Longest Palindromic Subsequence

A palindromic string is a string that is equal to its reverse. For example: “nitin” is a palindromic string. Now the question states to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a string. It is that palindromic subsequence of the given string with the greatest length.

Example Str = "bbbab"
output = "bbbb"
There can be many subsequences like “b”, “ba”,”bbb” but “bbbb” is the subsequence that is a palindrome and has the greatest length.

We need to print the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.


Approach
Pre-req: Longest Common Subsequence



Intuition:

Let us say that we are given the following string.


The longest palindromic subsequence will be: “babcbab”.

What is special about this string is that it is palindromic (equal to its reverse) and of the longest length.

Now let us write the reverse of str next to it and please think about the highlighted characters.


If we look closely at the highlighted characters, they are nothing but the longest common subsequence of the two strings.

Now, we have taken the reverse of the string for the following two reasons:

The longest palindromic subsequence being a palindrome will remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
The length of the palindromic subsequence will also remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
From the above discussion we can conclude:

The longest palindromic subsequence of a string is the longest common subsequence of the given string and its reverse.

Approach:

The algorithm is stated as follows:

We are given a string (say s), make a copy of it and store it( say string t).
Reverse the original string s.
Find the longest common subsequence 

Code

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int lcs(string s1, string s2) {
    
    int n=s1.size();
    int m=s2.size();

    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1,vector<int>(m+1,-1));
    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
        dp[i][0] = 0;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<=m;i++){
        dp[0][i] = 0;
    }
    
    for(int ind1=1;ind1<=n;ind1++){
        for(int ind2=1;ind2<=m;ind2++){
            if(s1[ind1-1]==s2[ind2-1])
                dp[ind1][ind2] = 1 + dp[ind1-1][ind2-1];
            else
                dp[ind1][ind2] = 0 + max(dp[ind1-1][ind2],dp[ind1][ind2-1]);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][m];
}

int longestPalindromeSubsequence(string s){
    string t = s;
    reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
    return lcs(s,t);
}

int main() {

  string s= "bbabcbcab";
                                 
  cout<<"The Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence is "<<
  longestPalindromeSubsequence(s);
}

Output: The Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence is 7

Time Complexity: O(N*N)

Reason: There are two nested loops

Space Complexity: O(N*N)

Reason: We are using an external array of size ‘(N*N)’. Stack Space is eliminated.
