### Input: 
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
### Output: 
6
### Explanation: 
The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

### Constraints:
n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105
